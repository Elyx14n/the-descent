# Third-party skill attribution

`grill-with-docs/`, `grilling/`, and `domain-modeling/` are adapted from [Matt Pocock's skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills). The dependencies were copied from the locally installed skills on 2026-09-29; their exact upstream revision was not recorded. Supporting format files and agent metadata are included.

These copies are maintained with this project. Adaptations resolve dependencies through relative file links, allow investigation without a sub-agent, preserve existing user authorization, and retain this repository's broader role for `CONTEXT.md`. Project ADRs under `docs/adr/` are distinct from SDK documentation. The Claude entry is a project-owned forwarding file.

The upstream installer entry for `grill-with-docs` was removed from `skills-lock.json` because these are local adaptations, not an unchanged installed package. Review future upstream updates manually.
